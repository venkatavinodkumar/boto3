Using an Amazon S3 Bucket as a Static Web Host
##############################################

This Python example shows you how to set up an Amazon S3 bucket as a static web host.
The Scenario

In this example, Python code is used to configure any of your buckets to act as a static web host. 
The code uses the AWS SDK for Python to configure a selected Amazon S3 bucket using these methods 
of the Amazon S3 client class:

* `get_bucket_website <https://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/services/s3.html#S3.Client.get_bucket_website>`_

* `put_bucket_website <https://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/services/s3.html#S3.Client.put_bucket_website>`_

* `delete_bucket_website <https://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/services/s3.html#S3.Client.delete_bucket_website>`_

For more information about using an Amazon S3 bucket as a static web host, see 
`Hosting a Static Website on Amazon S3 <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/WebsiteHosting.html>`_ 
in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide*.

All the example code for the Amazon Web Services (AWS) SDK for Python is available `here on GitHub <https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/master/python/example_code>`_.

Prerequisite Tasks
==================

To set up and run this example, you must first complete this task:

* Configure your AWS credentials, as described in :doc:`quickstart`.

Get the Current Bucket Website Configuration
=============================================

The example below shows how to:
 
* Get the bucket website configuration using 
  `get_bucket_website <https://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/services/s3.html#S3.Client.get_bucket_website>`_.
 
Example
-------

.. code-block:: python

    import boto3

    # Create an S3 client
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')

    # Call to S3 to retrieve the policy for the given bucket
    result = s3.get_bucket_website(Bucket='my-bucket')
 
Set a Bucket Website Configuration
==================================

The example below shows how to:
 
* Set a bucket website configuration using 
  `put_bucket_website <https://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/services/s3.html#S3.Client.put_bucket_website>`_.
 
Example
-------

.. code-block:: python

    import boto3

    # Create an S3 client
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')

    # Create the configuration for the website
    website_configuration = {
        'ErrorDocument': {'Key': 'error.html'},
        'IndexDocument': {'Suffix': 'index.html'},
    }

    # Set the new policy on the selected bucket
    s3.put_bucket_website(
        Bucket='my-bucket',
        WebsiteConfiguration=website_configuration
    )

 
Delete a Bucket Website Configuration
=====================================

The example below shows how to:
 
* Delete a bucket website configuration using 
  `delete_bucket_website <https://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/services/s3.html#S3.Client.delete_bucket_website>`_.
 
Example
-------

.. code-block:: python

    import boto3

    # Create an S3 client
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')

    # Call S3 to delete the website policy for the given bucket
    s3.delete_bucket_website(Bucket='my-bucket')

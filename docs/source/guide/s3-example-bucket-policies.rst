Working with Amazon S3 Bucket Policies
######################################

This Python example shows you how to:

* Get the bucket policy of an Amazon S3 bucket.

* Add or update the bucket policy of an Amazon S3 bucket.

* Delete the bucket policy of an Amazon S3 bucket.

The Scenario
============

In this example, Python code is used to get, set, or delete a bucket policy on an Amazon S3 bucket. 
The code uses the AWS SDK for Python to configure policy for a selected Amazon S3 bucket using these 
methods of the Amazon S3 client class:

* `get_bucket_policy <https://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/services/s3.html#S3.Client.get_bucket_policy>`_.

* `put_bucket_policy <https://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/services/s3.html#S3.Client.put_bucket_policy>`_.

* `delete_bucket_policy <https://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/services/s3.html#S3.Client.delete_bucket_policy>`_

For more information about bucket policies for Amazon S3 buckets, see 
`Using Bucket Policies and User Policies <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/using-iam-policies.html>`_ 
in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide*.

All the example code for the Amazon Web Services (AWS) SDK for Python is available `here on GitHub <https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/master/python/example_code>`_.

Prerequisite Tasks
==================

To set up and run this example, you must first complete this task:

* Configure your AWS credentials, as described in :doc:`quickstart`.

Get the Current Bucket Policy
=============================

The example below shows how to:
 
* Get the bucket ACL for a specified bucket using 
  `get_bucket_policy <https://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/services/s3.html#S3.Client.get_bucket_policy>`_.
 
Example
-------

.. code-block:: python

    import boto3

    # Create an S3 client
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')

    # Call to S3 to retrieve the policy for the given bucket
    result = s3.get_bucket_policy(Bucket='my-bucket')
    print(result)

    

    
Set a Simple Bucket Policy
==========================

The example below shows how to:
 
* Set the bucket policy for a specified bucket using 
  `put_bucket_policy <https://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/services/s3.html#S3.Client.put_bucket_policy>`_.
 
Example
-------

.. code-block:: python

    import boto3
    import json

    # Create an S3 client
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')

    bucket_name = 'my-bucket'

    # Create the bucket policy
    bucket_policy = {
        'Version': '2012-10-17',
        'Statement': [{
            'Sid': 'AddPerm',
            'Effect': 'Allow',
            'Principal': '*',
            'Action': ['s3:GetObject'],
            'Resource': "arn:aws:s3:::%s/*" % bucket_name
        }]
    }

    # Convert the policy to a JSON string
    bucket_policy = json.dumps(bucket_policy)

    # Set the new policy on the given bucket
    s3.put_bucket_policy(Bucket=bucket_name, Policy=bucket_policy)

 
Delete a Bucket Policy
======================

The example below shows how to:
 
* Delete a bucket policy for a specified bucket using 
  `delete_bucket_policy <https://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/services/s3.html#S3.Client.delete_bucket_policy>`_.
 
Example
-------

.. code-block:: python

    import boto3

    # Create an S3 client
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')

    # Call S3 to delete the policy for the given bucket
    s3.delete_bucket_policy(Bucket='my-bucket')

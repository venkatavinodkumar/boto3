Downloading a File from an S3 Bucket
####################################

   :description: Use the AWS SDK for Python (aka Boto) to download a file from an S3 bucket.
   :keywords: download file, s3, bucket

This example shows how to download a file from an S3 bucket, using :py:meth:`S3.Bucket.download_file`.

Prerequisites
=============

To set up and run this example, you must first:

* Configure your AWS credentials, as described in :doc:`quickstart`.
* Create an S3 bucket and upload a file to the bucket.
* Replace the ``BUCKET_NAME`` and ``KEY`` values in the code snippet with the name of your bucket and the key for the uploaded file.

Downloading a File
==================

The example below tries to download an S3 object to a file. If the service returns a 404 error, it prints an error message indicating that the object doesn't exist.

.. code-block:: python

    import boto3
    import botocore

    BUCKET_NAME = 'my-bucket' # replace with your bucket name
    KEY = 'my_image_in_s3.jpg' # replace with your object key

    s3 = boto3.resource('s3')

    try:
        s3.Bucket(BUCKET_NAME).download_file(KEY, 'my_local_image.jpg')
    except botocore.exceptions.ClientError as e:
        if e.response['Error']['Code'] == "404":
            print("The object does not exist.")
        else:
            raise

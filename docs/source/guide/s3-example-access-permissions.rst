Managing Amazon S3 Bucket Access Permissions
############################################

This Python example shows you how to get or set the access control list for an Amazon S3 bucket.

The Scenario
============

In this example, a Python code is used to display the bucket access control list (ACL) for a selected 
bucket. The code uses the AWS SDK for Python to manage Amazon S3 bucket access permissions using this 
method of the Amazon S3 client class:

* `get_bucket_acl <https://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/services/s3.html#S3.Client.get_bucket_acl>`_.

For more information about access control lists for Amazon S3 buckets, see 
`Managing Access with ACLs <http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/dev/S3_ACLs_UsingACLs.html>`_ 
in the *Amazon Simple Storage Service Developer Guide*.

All the example code for the Amazon Web Services (AWS) SDK for Python is available `here on GitHub <https://github.com/awsdocs/aws-doc-sdk-examples/tree/master/python/example_code>`_.

Prerequisite Tasks
==================

To set up and run this example, you must first complete this task:

* Configure your AWS credentials, as described in :doc:`quickstart`.

Get a Specified Bucket Access Control (ACL) List
================================================

Access control lists (ACLs) are one of the resource-based access policy option you can use to manage 
access to your buckets and objects. You can use ACLs to grant basic read/write permissions to other 
AWS accounts.

The example below shows how to:
 
* Get the bucket ACL for a specified bucket using 
  `get_bucket_acl <https://boto3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/reference/services/s3.html#S3.Client.get_bucket_acl>`_.
 
Example
-------

.. code-block:: python

    import boto3

    # Create an S3 client
    s3 = boto3.client('s3')

    # Call to S3 to retrieve the policy for the given bucket
    result = s3.get_bucket_acl(Bucket='my-bucket')
    print(result)
